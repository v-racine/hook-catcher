## Project Intent
Practice Front-end development by building the front-end of a "RequestBasket" app.  This project is inspired by the one created by darklynx (https://github.com/darklynx/request-baskets).  The backend is being built by another team, with a RESTful API.

## Dependencies
Runtime dependencies:
  - React v19
  - ReactRouter v7
  - Zod: Use if possible, but don't use it if it becomes too cumbersome to learn it along with everything else
  
  Not a dependency:
  - Fetch (use the built-in API, not Axios)

Avoiding these dependencies for now:
- React Hook Form: Simpler, more declarative forms with schema validation by Zod
- A data-fetching solution such as TanStack Query or useSWR: definitely the more robust option, but skipping for now because we don't have that skillset yet

Development dependencies:
  - Vite
  - TypeScript
  - Husky pre-commit hooks to enforce:
	  - testing
	  - linting
	  - formatting
  - ESLint for linting TS, React, imports, general code quality.  These plugins are installed by Vite when creating a React + TS project:
	  - `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin` 
	  - `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`
  - Prettier (VSCode plugin and dev dependency for use by commit hooks) for formatting
  - shadcn-ui (component library built on RadixUI)

### React Router
We're using v7 "Declarative Mode", including the `BrowserRouter` provider.: https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/installation.  Declarative mode is the simplest.  There might be an advantage to using 'Data' mode, but since this is a learning project, let's stick with the simple setup (more info on different modes: https://reactrouter.com/start/modes).  

### ShadCN Theme
It's hard to go wrong, but here's a nice soothing green: https://ui.shadcn.com/create?preset=a1VO1nE

## Testing
TBD if automated testing will be implemented at this stage.  May stick with manual testing for now.

## Project Layout
Generally inspired by modern best practices as defined by [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react), with some simplifications that are more inline with the tutorials on FullStackOpen.com/en

Notes on the above filetree:
- `[1]` [Bulletproof React - src/config/env.ts](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/apps/react-vite/src/config/env.ts)
- `[2]`  "When your application interacts with either RESTful or GraphQL APIs, it is beneficial to use a single instance of the API client that has been pre-configured and can be reused throughout the application. " [Bulletproof React "API Layer"](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/api-layer.md)
- `[3]` Short version: the `cn` helper inside `src/lib/utils`  is required for proper functioning of shadcn components.  Long version: the `cn` helper is described in a couple of locations:  [shadcn 'cn helper' in the "Installation manual"](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/manual), [shadcn CLI Reference](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli#init).  It combines the `tailwind-merge` library ([github](https://github.com/dcastil/tailwind-merge/?tab=readme-ov-file)) and the `clsx` library ([github](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx?tab=readme-ov-file#tailwind-support)) to enable conflict resolution for CSS class strings, and conditionally applying classes to a given component.

## My Scaffolding plan / log

### Setup Vite, React, TS, ShadCN, Tailwind using the ShadCN CLI
Setup ReactRouter using the shadcn CLI
```bash
$ npx shadcn@latest init --preset a1VO1nE --template vite
```



If your filesystem is polluted with [AppleDouble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleSingle_and_AppleDouble_formats) files (files prefixed with `._`), delete them:
```bash
find . -name '._*'  # preview what you're about to delete

# Then use the -delete flag to actually trash em
# find . -name '._*' -delete
```


Configure path aliases in `tsconfig.json`.  As of 2026, `npx shadcn init` (executed in the above step) automatically creates an alias for `~/*`, which can be renamed if you are careful to fix any project references, including in `components.json`.
```json title:tsconfig.json
"compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["./src/*"]
    }
  }
```


> [!NOTE] This might be necessary for some projects
> Give Vite the ability to resolve imports using TS path mapping 
> ```
> npm install --save-dev vite-tsconfig-paths
> ```
> (more info: https://github.com/aleclarson/vite-tsconfig-paths)


Make sure everything installed correctly
```bash
npm run dev  # verify in your browser
```

Paths still not resolving properly?  Try deleting the `.vite` directory (clearing the Vite cache) and restarting the dev server.

### Install ReactRouter and other runtime dependencies
```bash
npm i react-router zod
```
No need to configure ReactRouter right now, you can do it later. Docs: https://reactrouter.com/start/declarative/installation

### Install and configure Prettier
Install [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/install#set-up-your-editor).  The commented out lines in the below code block are recommended by the Prettier Docs, but ShadCN installer seems to do a better job with those configs.
```bash
npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
# node --eval "fs.writeFileSync('.prettierrc','{}\n')"
# node --eval "fs.writeFileSync('.prettierignore','# Ignore artifacts:\nbuild\ncoverage\n')"
```
Prettier recommends the `--save-exact` flag:
> If you forget to install Prettier first, npx will temporarily download the latest version. That’s not a good idea when using Prettier, because we change how code is formatted in each release! It’s important to have a locked down version of Prettier in your package.json.

### Install and configure ESLint using "airbnb-extended"
[airbnb-extended](https://github.com/eslint-config/airbnb-extended) provides an ESLint flat-file config (modern as of 2026) that includes support for TypeScript.

Run the automated setup, and make sure you tell the CLI that you're using Prettier!
```bash
npx create-airbnb-x-config
```
More info: 
- Basics: https://eslint-airbnb-extended.nishargshah.dev/config/installation
- Detailed guide: https://eslint-airbnb-extended.nishargshah.dev/cli/guide

For this project, I did:
```bash fold
$ npx create-airbnb-x-config
✔ Config? … Legacy / Extended
✔ Are you using typescript? … No / Yes
✔ Are you using prettier? … No / Yes
✔ Are you using? › React/React Router/Remix
✔ Do you want to add strict configs? … No / Yes
✔ Should I create an eslint.config.mjs file for you? … No / Yes
✔ Do you want to skip the package installation? … No / Yes
